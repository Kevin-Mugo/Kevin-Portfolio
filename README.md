# Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio ðŸš€

#### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kevin Mugo, a data scientist passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights. In this repository, you'll find a collection of projects showcasing my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. I am passionate about data science and its applications to solve real-world problems.

## Projects
- [Customer segmentation modelling](https://github.com/anzykenya/Customer-Segmenation): Executed a customer segmentation modeling project utilizing data analysis and machine learning, optimizing strategies to increase profits by 35%. Utilized Python, Scikit-Learn, and 
visualization tools (Seaborn and Matplotlib) to identify and target high-value customer segments effectively.

- [Credit Scoring for financial institutions](https://github.com/anzykenya/Credit-scoring-Project): Executed a credit scoring project for financial institutions, implementing statistical analysis and machine learning to classify loans as good or bad based on diverse features. Achieved an 82% accuracy rate for the model, enhancing risk assessment capabilities.
  
- [Python Data Cleaning](https://github.com/anzykenya/Python_data_cleaning.): Executed a comprehensive data cleaning project on the FIFA21 dataset, addressing various issues identified during exploration and analysis. Leveraged Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Jupyter Notebooks to enhance data quality and consistency.

   - Thoroughly examined dataset structure and columns, creating a data dictionary from online sources to understand attribute meanings.
   - Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights, identify patterns, and uncover anomalies.
   - Addressed missing values in the 'Hits' and 'Loan Date End' columns with careful computation based on the nature of the data.
   - Resolved inconsistent formatting, particularly in the 'Heights' and 'Weights' columns, by applying transformations, lambda functions, and normalization techniques.
   - Implemented validation and quality checks to ensure the cleaned dataset's integrity, accuracy, and overall quality.
  
This data cleaning initiative aims to provide a reliable foundation for future analyses and modeling tasks related to the FIFA21 dataset to ensure 99% accuracy on insights generated.

- [Predictive Modeling for House Prices](https://github.com/anzykenya/Housing_predictions-model): Implemented a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features.
- [Candy data analysis ](https://github.com/anzykenya/Candy-data-analyis): Analysis of candy data with visualizations performed using scatter plots.
- [Gaming data analysis  ](https://github.com/anzykenya/Gaming-data-analysis): Visualization of gaming data using bar charts and heat maps after data cleaning.
- [Starbucks outlets analysis  ](https://github.com/anzykenya/Starbucks-Analysis): exploratory data analysis to investigate demographics of various counties in California state , to determine suitable locations for new outlets.
- [Medical data  analysis  ](https://github.com/anzykenya/Medical-data-analysis): Visualizing and making calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas.
- [Feature engineering  ](https://github.com/anzykenya/Feature-engineering1):Developing the features identified as having the most potential and make sense from a real-world perspective, and whether there are any useful combinations that stand out.
- [Stochastic gradient descent for a machine leaarning model  ](https://github.com/anzykenya/SGD/blob/main/SGD.ipynb):Training a neural network on the Fuel Economy dataset
